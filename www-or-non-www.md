# www or non-www

## Set your preferred domain \(www or non-www\)

The preferred domain is the one that you would liked used to index your site's pages \(sometimes this is referred to as the canonical domain\). Links may point to your site using both the www and non-www versions of the URL \(for instance, http://www.example.com and http://example.com\).

### The preferred domain is the version that you want used for your site in the search results.

Once you tell Google about  your preferred domain name, Google uses that information for all future crawls of your site and indexing refreshes. For instance, if you specify your preferred domain as http://www.example.com and Google find a link to your site that is formatted as http://example.com, Google follow that link as http://www.example.com instead.

 In addition, Google take your preference into account when displaying the URLs. If you don't specify a preferred domain, Google may treat the www and non-www versions of the domain as separate references to separate pages.

### It may take some time before you see this change fully reflected in our index. 

All pages that currently display the non-preferred version of the URL in the index will remain in the index that way until Google refresh  indexing of those pages.

### Specify a preferred domain:

1. On the Search Console Home page, click the site you want.
2. Click the gear icon ![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6iD_JcqCzlkeCEcs6mwEdck4AC1tqiFx7Jk6Ww_OtvL1bE4KMYN-PeXkMYNm1Q=w18), and then click **Site Settings**.
3. In the **Preferred domain** section, select the option you want.


You are free to use use any sub-domain but Vintcer at least requires one domain name.
